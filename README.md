# robot-dance-party
This was built with HTML and CSS as part of a Web Development course I took in 2021. It began as just one robot with a growing head and dancing foot and then expanded into a party with tilts, twirls, and bobs. I would like to come back at some point and make it even more interactive with JavaScript. It always bring me joy.
